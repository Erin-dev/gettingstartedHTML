<p> <u> "Hello World!" </u> </p>
<p> <u> The Sun is also a Star </u> </p>
<p> By, <u> Nicola Yoon </u> </p>
<p> When the novel begins, seventeen year-old Natasha leaves her family’s apartment to try to find a way to prevent their deportation. Their deportation has been brought on by a DUI her father received after drinking following a <b> <i> theater </b> </i> performance in which he acted, wherein he told the police he and his family were in America <b> <i> illegally </b> </i>. At the same time, 17-year-old Daniel heads out to get his hair cut and go to an interview with a Yale college alumnus. Daniel is under <b> <i> heavy </b> </i> pressure by his Korean-native parents who insist upon the meeting as Daniel’s brother Charlie has been forced home from Harvard for two semesters on probation. </p>
